                <h2>Our Mission: A more ethical food</h2>
                <p>At Canopy Kelowna we suspect that you don't have a problem with killing bugs. If you do, then the following website is not for you, and we respect that!</p>
                <p>Our goal is to function as an investigative body into the many aspects of edible bugs. For many <a href="https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/why-go-vegan">reasons</a> we think that it is important to move away from using sentient animals
                    like chickens, cows, and pigs as food. We think it is worthwhile to look into the possibility that traditional western meat sources can be replaced with crickets, mealworms, and mosquitos.</p>

                <p>
                    In particular we are hoping to understand and help advance the following aspects of an edible insect economy.
                </p>

                <h3>Psychology</h3>
                <p>Our goal is to serve as a gateway for western civilization to enter the wonderful, bountiful and sustainable world of edible insects. We believe that food should be cheap, healthy and cause minimal damage to our environment.</p>
